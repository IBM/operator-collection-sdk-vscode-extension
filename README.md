## Getting Started

1. Install the extension using the local install instructions

## Installing VS Code Extension

1. Download the `.vsix` file from the latest release in the [operator-collection-sdk-vscode-extension Github repository](https://github.com/IBM/operator-collection-sdk-vscode-extension/releases)
2. Install the extension to your VS Code editor using one of the following options below.

   - **Using the [code CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download):** Execute the `extensionName=$(ls *.vsix) && code --install-extension ${extensionName}` command to install the VS Code extension to your editor
   - **Using the VS Code command palette:**

     1. From your VS Code editor, open the VS Code command palette by issuing the `CMD + SHIFT + P` command on Mac, or the `CTRL + SHIFT + P` command on Windows.
     1. Search for `Extensions` in the command palette, and click on the `Extensions: Install from VSIX` command
     1. Locate the `.vsix` file on your filesystem and click `Install`

## Trouble Shooting

If you experience the `urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]` issue, you may need to install and use SSL Certificates before running this extension.

To install SSL Certificates in Python, navigate to your python folder and run the `Certificates` command from your terminal:

```cmd
cd <PATH_TO_PYTHON>
./Install\ Certificates.command
```

Alternatively, you can install the [`certifi`](https://pypi.org/project/certifi/) package via `pip`:

```cmd
pip install certifi
```
